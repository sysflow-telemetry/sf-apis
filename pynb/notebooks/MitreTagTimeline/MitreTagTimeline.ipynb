    "Today's compute environments are typically well monitored by multiple different network- and host-based sensors - producing a large amount of events and alerts even after careful tuning.\n",
    "In case of a complex attack chain, where an attacker is able to break into an internal system and move to other systems, gain privileges and get access to data, different alerts will be created during the attacker's activities.\n",
    "While the detailed monitoring is great to catch and mitigate very specific attack steps, it can be hard to get the bigger picture of the attack operation and understand the overall goals (and results) of the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we explore one possible way to abstract from the details to a higher-level understanding of an attack chain to expose the 'storyline' of the attack with the help of MITRE tags - complementary to the lower-level details of alerts.\n",
    "The [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework defines a \"globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations\", i.e., describes the different kinds of possible attack steps in a systematic way, independent from any particular tool. For each of the documented techniques/sub-techniques the MITRE ATT&CK includes textual context, examples, ways of mitigations and detections and references. \n",
    "It is structured into a set of 14 high-level tactics, like reconnaissance, initial access, privileged escalation etc, each of which is comprised of many techniques and sub-techniques in a hierarchical fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "One concrete example for illustration is the [Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) with the MITRE tag T1059.001. It describes the potential abuse of the PowerShell by adversaries for execution of malicious tasks. The tag T1059.001 indicates that this is the sub-technique 1 of the technique [T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter ](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) that in turn is part of the high-level tactic [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly important is that this effort is independent of any specific tool and thereby can be used to understand attack steps across multiple tools. Support for tagging the tool-specific alerts with MITRE tags are in many cases under way or already available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition suggests that a more complex attack chain will have some typical sequence of phases at a higher level, proceeding maybe in progression like discovery → initial access → privilege escalation → data exfiltration → persistence (although this in general will not be a strict sequence of phases, as an attacker might skip or repeat phases, e.g., after further lateral movements). \n",
    "\n",
    "To test and illustrate this approach we have created a small test environment. In this setup, we use a known, scripted attack scenario while observing the environment with multiple sensors and collect the alerts generated by the sensors. Instead of looking at the details of these alerts, we here go in the opposite direction of abstracting from the low-level, detailed alerts to look only at the timeline of the MITRE tags associated with the alerts."

    "The small environment that we use for testing is shown in the above figure: the blue parts are the 'productive' components comprised of a web application `juice-shop`, a MySQL server and MS Windows server.

    "[Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop) for testing and learning. We use it on a Linux VM and on the Windows VM as an easy way for us to create an attack scenario targetting some of the known vulnerabilities of the Juice-Shop. \n",
    "In addition, there are a small number of VMs that act as simulated users of the webshop in order to create 'normal' background traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monitoring components are shown in green: we monitor the Linux VMs with SysFlow, the network is monitored by Snort and for the Windows server we have a setup that feeds Sysmon events through Winlogbeat into an instance of [HELK](https://github. com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK). In this article, we only look at alerts (rather then the base telemetry events produced by SysFlow/Sysmon) that are generated by a TTP ruleset on the SysFlow side and the set of [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) rules on the Sysmon side. The alerts based on the Sysmon events are in this setting created by [ElastAlert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert) that is part of the HELK package and is configured to use the set of Sigma rules.\n",
    "With regards to the current availability of MITRE tags: \n",
    "- the TTP ruleset used by SysFlow already contains MITRE tags, and the team is continually extending the existing list\n",
    "- also Sigma rules already are enriched with MITRE tags that we can use in ElastAlert\n",
    "- Snort rules currently have no MITRE tags attached currently - in this case we manually added MITRE tag information to selected rules.\n",

    "Our setup also contains a transformation of the alerts into the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www. elastic.co/what-is/ecs/) format for normalisation as part of the pipeline before they are collected in two instances of ElasticSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SysFlow this capability to convert events and alerts to the ECS format and storage into ElasticSearch was added in version 0.3.0 - you can find details about it in the [blog](https://sysflow.io/2021/08/20/elk-integration.html) together with a detailed [demonstration](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-deployments/tree/dev/integrations/elk)."

Another round of discovery operations precedes more alerts with a similar sequence of access-escalation-execution and alerts tagged as lateral movement and persistence. With that high level view, looking into the details of selected alerts will confirm that the first set of alerts were related to the linux machines in our setup, whereas the later alerts come from the monitoring of our Windows machine - confirming the lateral movement that is hinted by the timeline of the tactics.\n",

    "When we compare the timeline of tactics with the annotated ground-truth information from the log of the attack script, we find that many steps are nicely visible in the collected alerts, i.e., the scanning 'discovery' actions, the break-in via the SSTI attack followed by the reverse shell; the attempted database logins followed by a successful login and data exfiltration; the lateral movement to the Windows server with the concluding installation of a backdoor user.\n",

Though this is not visible on the level of the alerts, the collected alerts make us aware of a larger attack scenario and raise our suspicion to trigger further investigations. In out case at hand, looking at the detailed telemetry of the collected events (like SysFlow and Sysmon events in our case) will show the details, i.e., we will find that with the non-interactive PowerShell the attacker was able to install the OpenSSH server and that this was used later on as access point for the backdoor user to collect files from the victim machine."

This could indicate parts of a longer running attack, possibly prompting to query more data to fill in potential gaps visible from that level of view to further understand consequences of the attack.\n",

    "Further work is required, especially testing this approach with a broader set of attack scenarios in a more complex environment (including more background traffic), to evaluate whether this can be helpful for a human operator to identify the ’storyline’ of an attack.\n",
